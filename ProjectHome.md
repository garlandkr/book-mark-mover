# Intro #
So I heard the news about delicious going under, or needing new ownership or whatever, and decided I needed to jump ship. There were a few documents on the web about importing/converting to other sites like Diigo, but they didn't work. Also, the conversion steps for Google Bookmarks loses all of your tags. That's not acceptable. This tool also keeps the notes you may have created.

# What it does #
This tool can already take your exported .html from delicious and parse through the elements, turning them into dictionaries with the following format:

```
{ '1':
  {'bkmk':
    u'http://www.google.com',
    'labels': u'google,search',
    'title': u'Google Search'
  }
}
```

The keys are generated by a counter which increments by ones. Originally this was going to be the 'add\_date' tag inside the anchor of the bookmark, but the possibility of similar keys existed.

# Future #
Currently the mechanized portion is being worked on to allow posting to the Google Bookmarks homepage.

# Requirements #
Python 2.7,
Mechanize,
BeautifulSoup,
